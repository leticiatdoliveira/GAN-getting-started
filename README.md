# GAN-Torch-Getting-Started

This repository serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch. 
It is designed to document and showcase my learning journey as I explore and implement some basic GAN architectures.

## Purpose

- To understand the foundational concepts behind GANs.
- To practice implementing popular GAN architectures, such as Vanilla GAN, DCGAN, and Conditional GAN.
- To serve as a reference and portfolio of my GAN projects using PyTorch.

## What's Inside

- **Implementations**: Hands-on code for different GAN architectures.
- **Experiments**: Examples of my training GANs on simple datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.
- **Resources**: Colab notebooks 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GAN-Torch-Getting-Started.git
   cd GAN-Torch-Getting-Started
   ```
